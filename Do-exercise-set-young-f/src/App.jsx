            <h2>How does react works ?</h2>
            <p>ReactJS divides the UI into isolated reusable pieces of code known as components.React components <br />  work similarly to JavaScript functions as they accept arbitrary inputs called properties or props. <br />  Itâ€™s possible to have as many components as necessary without cluttering your code</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Differences between props and state ?</h2>
            <p>State is owned locally and the component itself updates it. Props are owned and read-only by a parent.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2>Uses of useEffect ?</h2>
            <p>Running on state change:validating input field, live filtering, trigger animation on new array value.</p>
